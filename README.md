# Capital One OCR Project

Capital One receives thousands requests via mail every month from customers requesting to change data listed on their credit report. 
Presently, employees must scan these letters into an electronic database, however they must still manually read these letters to extract
important information such as the customerâ€™s name, address, SSN, account numbers, etc.  The proposed system will ingest scanned letters
and process them using OCR and Natural Language Processing technology to extract relevant customer details and add them to the database,
as well as attempt to detect if the request is frivolous. This will save Capital One employees time and increase the number of letters
Capital One can process without needing to hire additional staff.
